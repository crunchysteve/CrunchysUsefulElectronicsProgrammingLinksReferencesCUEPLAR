# Crunchy's Useful Electronics & Programming Links & References (CUEPLAR) 
####(Edit date: 20240109 15:58)
<hr />

Just a personal list of links to online reference books for current projects. Public because not everybody knows where to find this stuff at the beginning and Google can be no help some days! There's a little order to this list, but it is still very much a "no particular order" kind of beast.

If you find any links have changed, broken or otherwise gone AWOL, open an issue, preferrably with a new link if you can find one.

- ## Electronics
  1. [Electronics Tutorials](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/): Great general electronics site.
  2. [Operational Amplifiers and Linear Integrated Circuits - Theory and Application (Fiore)](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Electrical_Engineering/Electronics/Operational_Amplifiers_and_Linear_Integrated_Circuits_-_Theory_and_Application_(Fiore)): A free, open book on Libre Texts on all matters of operational amplifier design

- ## Programming
  - ### Javascript
  1. [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/): Javascript breaks my brain like C/C++ never did, but I work through this a bit at a time. Maybe one day I'll be able to JS the shit out of things.
  - ### Arduino
  1. [Arduino Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/): The go-to source for Arduino flavoured C
  2. [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/): I don't yet Python, but I'm maintaining this info-repo for everybody, and maybe, one day I might have a project where I'll need this. Adafruit are awesome!
  3. PlatformIO Docs](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/): Still coding in ArduinoIDE? Level up, dudes!

- ## General Pages and Apps
  1.  [Joplin Notes](https://joplinapp.org/): Probably the BEST and totally FOSS note-keeping app I have ever found. Evernote users feel right at home here, blows Apple Notes out of the freakin' water. I wish I'd had this in high school 45 years ago! I'd have gotten that programming degree and had my own startup. (I'm ND and this has made my life less chaotic!)
  2.  [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/): Still coding in ArduinoIDE? Level up, dudes! Seriously!  Do I have to nag?

There is more to come. This is going to take a while to build, lots of web crawling, lots of organising my Joplin notes. If you have any sites you'd like for consideration in this list, open an issue with the link in the body and your idea of which section you'd like it included in.
