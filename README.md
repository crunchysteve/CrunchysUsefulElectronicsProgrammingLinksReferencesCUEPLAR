Just a personal list of links to online reference books for current projects. Public because not everybody knows where to find this stuff at the beginning and Google can be no help some days!

1. [Electronics Tutorials](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/)
2. [Operational Amplifiers and Linear Integrated Circuits - Theory and Application (Fiore)](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Electrical_Engineering/Electronics/Operational_Amplifiers_and_Linear_Integrated_Circuits_-_Theory_and_Application_(Fiore))
